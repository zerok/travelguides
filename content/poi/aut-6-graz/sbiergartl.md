s'Biergartl is a typical Austrian restaurant with a large menu. The focus here is on non-vegetarian meals but there are also some vegetarian options. If you're into things like that, give the "Bauern-Cordon Bleu" a try! Make sure, though, not to have any plans for eating anything else that day 😁

During the summer months the restaurant also offers a nice little biergarden. 

If you plan to go there during lunch hours, there is also a buffet with two choices available for a reasonable price.
