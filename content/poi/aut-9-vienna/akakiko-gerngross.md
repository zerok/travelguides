While Akakiko might not be the best place for Asian food, the location is
what makes this restaurant special. On its roof-top-terrace you get a nice view
over the South of Vienna while eating a delicious Ramen ðŸ˜‰

The entrance to this little gem is quite well-hidden, though. Right before
entering the Gerngross mall from the Mariahilfer StraÃŸe, take the elevator
to your right.
