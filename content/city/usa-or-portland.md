## Hotels et al.

Hotels in Portland are quite expensive. Nowhere near as expensive as in San Francisco, mind you, but you will still have to spend quite a bit of money. If you're staying for more than just a couple of days, you might want to look into Airbnb. Especially in the neighborhoods on the east-side of the river (Buckman et al.) there are some really nice apartments available that are also affordable.

## Public transport

Portland has an excellent public transport network consisting of busses, trams, and Max-lines that are something between a tram and a train.

Tickets are available through a dedicated [iOS and Android app](http://trimet.org/app/index.htm), but also through [trimet.org](http://trimet.org) and dedicated vending machines at every Max stop and other places.

You are only allowed to enter a bus on the front where you're are also expected to greet the driver and show your ticket (app or paper). You can get off the bus also in the back but make sure to thank the driver again before leaving. That's one of these little things that makes Portland and their public transport system such a friendly place ❤️
